### What is Motives
Motives is an event planning platform that makes it easier to host a 'Motive' or find a 'Motive' near you. Motives was inspired by the experience university students, like myself, faced within a hybrid-school model. The lack of many in-person social opportunities negatively impacted the university experience. As Covid-19 restrictions begin to lift, Motives is intended to help people makeup for lost time and accelerate the re-introduction of in-person social events!

Motives can be posted as public events for everyone to see or private events for your followers only. Use the Post a Motive feature to host your own events or find publicly posted motives near you on the Explore tab map! You can also find out what private events the people you follow are hosting in the Following tab. Finally, let the host know you're going to an event using the I'm Going button and keep track of the events you're going to using the My Motives tab!

### How I made it
Motives is a full stack web application made with the MERN stack. For the frontend, I used React, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. In the backend, I used Javascript, Express, Nodejs, and Mongodb to create various API endpoints and JWT for authentication. The website is hosted on AWS using EC2, Nginx and PM2.
